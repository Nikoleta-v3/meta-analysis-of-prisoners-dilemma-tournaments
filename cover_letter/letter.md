Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit our research paper entitled “Properties of Winning
Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma Strategies” by Nikoleta E. Glynatsi, Vincent Knight,
and Marc Harper for your consideration for publication in the Journal of Physics:
Complexity as part of the Focus Issue on Game Theory and AI in Complex Systems.

Exploring the performance of strategies in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD)
has been a topic of interest to the scientific community for decades, following
the pioneer work of Axelrod.
Corresponding works often introduce a new strategy, accompanied by a claim that
the new strategy is the best-performing strategy for the IPD, often without
extensive testing against a broad spectrum of opponents or representative
classes of opponents. Though the lack of testing against formally defined
strategies and tournament winners is understandable given the effort required to
implement the hundreds of published IPD strategies, the absence of thorough
testing raises concerns about claims regarding the superiority or robustness of
these newly introduced strategies.

In this work, we evaluate the performance of 195 strategies across thousands of
computer tournaments. Many of the strategies used in our analysis are drawn from
well-known and named strategies in IPD literature, including previous tournament
winners. Furthermore, our tournaments encompass variations, including standard
tournaments resembling Axelrod’s original ones, tournaments with noise,
probabilistic match length, and both noise and probabilistic match length.

We present the top-performing strategies across multiple tournament types and
distill their salient features. The results show that there is not yet a single
strategy that performs well in diverse Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma scenarios;
nevertheless, there are several properties that heavily influence the
best-performing strategies. This refines the properties described by Axelrod in
light of recent and more diverse opponent populations: be nice, be provocable
and generous, be a little envious, be clever, and adapt to the environment.

Our findings shed interesting light on why strategies such as Tit For Tat have
historically performed well in tournaments, while zero-determinant strategies
typically do not fare well in tournament settings. We demonstrate that diversity
in the population of opponent strategies is of paramount importance in the
construction and evaluation of game theory strategies. Furthermore, our findings
have implications for the future training of autonomous agents, as understanding
the crucial features for incorporation into these agents becomes essential.

We believe that our paper aligns with the scope and objectives of the Focus Issue on
Game Theory and AI in Complex Systems and will contribute to the ongoing
scientific discourse in the field of autonomous agents in repeated games.
Therefore, we would be delighted if this article could be considered for
publication in your journal.

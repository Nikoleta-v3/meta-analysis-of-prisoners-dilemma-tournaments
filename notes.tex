Overall look, on how cooperation affects performance. In the experiment that was help,
the meta data of given tournaments have been collected. The metadata include:

- cooperation rating $(C_{r})$
- median score
- rank $(r_{i})$
- wins
- cc_rate
- cd_rate
- dc_rate
- dd_rate
- noise
- probend
- repetitions
- seed
- size
- turns.

In this section we will rely on the rank to monitor the perfomance of the individuals within the tournaments and hopefully get some insights on our tournaments. More specificaly we will use the normalized rank $\bar{r_{i}} = \frac{r_{i}}{N_{i}}$, because there are different tournament sizes.

We will make use of some other mathematical representations as well, such as, the
index of the tournament $i$ and the number of players $N_{i}$.
